We are using this site to distrubute the new draft TERN
Landscapes soil data products for review as they become available.
Please do not distrubute them further than amongst the members of the
DSM Working Group at this stage.<br>
<br>
<h2>How to use this site</h2>
The main map displays The New products for review (SLGA_V2), the
observed data used to generate the maps and where available the
corresponsing original SLGA maps. These map layers can be turned on and
of in&nbsp; the layer control on the top right of the map.<br>
<br>
In the left panel you can chose the map to display by selecting the
Product (:Attributes), Product Type (where applicable) and depth (where
relevant).<br>
<br>
You can view information about the methods used to generate the new
prooducts and the statistical summary for the new product by clicking
on the links in the left panel<br>
<br>
You can download the data in the current map by clicking on the links
in the bot left panel. "Download Entire DataSet" will download the
entire national geotiff raster - up to 4GB in size. If you just want to
download a small section of the map you can just zoom in to the area of
interest and click the "Download Current Extent" link. This link will
only be displayed when you have zoomed in sufficiently<br>
<br>
To view the actual pixel data just click on the map and the values will
pop up. The same applies if you click on the observed data icons on the
